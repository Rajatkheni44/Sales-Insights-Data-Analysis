# Sales-Insights-Data-Analysis

I made a **Problem statement** of row data, which I got from Kaggle. The data was imported into SQL server and **visualized** in five different tables. Connect to the server and import all data into **Power BI**. **Data modeling** was also a part of my project.


I **cleaned** the data, (i.e - converted the currency, remove duplicate rows and deleted null values) and created a **dashboard** using Power BI for the **website** and **mobile devices**.
